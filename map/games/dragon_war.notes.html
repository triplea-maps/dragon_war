<br><span style="font-size:14px;color:FFBF6B;">The dangerous dragons of war have been extinct since the first age. The forces of evil have been dormant for centuries. The free peoples, Elves, Dwarves and the humans of Lionia, have been living in peace and security for generations. Or so they thought. In the places where evil dwells, a lust for more land, power and war has grown. Also, rumors of increased warmongering among the primitive races and sightings of young dragons create concern. It is now clear that the wicked king of Crowton, the blood lusting chief of the Greenskins and the unholy lord of the Undead have formed an evil alliance. They want to divide, subdue and enslave the entire world. Only a combined resistance by the good and free peoples can now defeat this evil. But, this time the good will not let the forces of darkness have monopoly on the mighty war beasts ... the dragons. </span>

<br>
<br><b><span style="font-size:16px;color:FFFA74;">Win Conditions:</span></b><br>
<br><span style="font-size:14px;color:FFFFFF;">Economic Victory is achieved by an alliance producing 250 PUs at the end of a round. Total Victory is achieved by controlling 5 of the 6 capital cities at the end of a round.</span><br>
<br>
<br><b><span style="font-size:16px;color:FFFA74;">General Information:</span></b><br>
<br><span style="font-size:14px;color:FFFFFF;">This is a 3 vs. 3 player map. But there are also several hostile AI players on the map. These players have 2 turns per round, one after evil and one after good.</span><br>
<br><span style="font-size:14px;color:FFFFFF;">The dices used are 8-sided.</span><br>
<br><span style="font-size:14px;color:FFFFFF;">Combat Moves and Non Combat Moves are done before Purchases and Placements.</span><br>
<br><span style="font-size:14px;color:FFFFFF;">Land, sea and air battles can only last up to 5 battle rounds.</span><br>
<br><span style="font-size:14px;color:FFFFFF;">Nations may build constructions (settlements, fortifications, siege weapons etc.) in newly conquered territories.</span><br>
<br><span style="font-size:14px;color:FFFFFF;">Rivers can only be crossed by air units. Land units can only cross by using bridges.</span><br>
<br><span style="font-size:14px;color:FFFFFF;">Some territories have special effects on specific units. These territories have icons below their territory names. The following territory effects are in play:</span><br>
<ul>
<li><span style="color:FFFFFF;">Mountain (prevents attackers from blitzing.)</span></li><br>
<li><span style="color:FFFFFF;">Desert (gives all infantry -1 Att./Def.)</span></li><br>
<li><span style="color:FFFFFF;">Swamp (gives all cavalry -1 Att./Def.)</span></li><br>
<li><span style="color:FFFFFF;">Forest (gives all artillery -1 Att./Def.</span>)</li><br>
<li><span style="color:FFFFFF;">Snow (gives all units -1 Att./Def.)</span></li><br>
<li><span style="color:FFFFFF;">Capital (gives all units +1 Def.)</span></li>
</ul>
<br><b><span style="font-size:16px;color:FFFA74;">Resources:</span></b><br>
<br><span style="font-size:14px;color:FFFFFF;">There are 4 resource types: PUs, Food, Wood and Metal. They are all used to buy units.</span><br>
<br><span style="font-size:14px;color:FFFFFF;">Resources are obtained by controlling territories, buildings and livestock.</span><br>
<br><span style="font-size:14px;color:FFFFFF;">Food can also be obtained by fishing in sea zones marked as fishing zones. Any ship type can fish by starting out its turn in a fishing zone, but only one ship can collect fish in one zone. Ships that move out of fishing zones will still collect food in that same round.</span><br>
<br><span style="font-size:14px;color:FFFFFF;">Nations start out with 15 PU incomes, but they also have Capital-City expenses of 15 PUs.</span><br>
<br><span style="font-size:14px;color:FFFFFF;">Nations can only buy new units after expanding their land and raising their PU income.</span><br>
<br><span style="font-size:14px;color:FFFFFF;">Expect 2-3 rounds to pass before being able to buy new units.</span><br>
<br><span style="font-size:14px;color:FFFFFF;">Bought units can be placed in Villages (1 unit), Towns (2 units) and Cities (3 units). These three types of settlements can only be placed on respectively 1 PU, 2 PU and 3 PU territories.</span><br>
<br><span style="font-size:14px;color:FFFFFF;">Units do not need to be placed in the same round as they are bought.</span><br>
<br><span style="font-size:14px;color:FFFFFF;">Each capital has a naval blockade zone. If enemies blockade this zone, PU income from all the surrounding territories may be lost.</span><br>
<br>
<br><b><span style="font-size:16px;color:FFFA74;">Units:</span></b><br>
<br><span style="font-size:14px;color:FFFFFF;">There are several unit classes:</span>
<ul>
<span style="color:FFFFFF;">Infantry (can all receive support.)</span></li><br>
<br><span style="color:FFFFFF;">Cavalry (all give 1 infantry unit att. support.)</span></li><br>
<br><span style="color:FFFFFF;">Artillery (all give 3 infantry units att. and/or def. support.)</span></li><br>
<br><span style="color:FFFFFF;">Air (most can carry characters around the map.)</span></li><br>
<br><span style="color:FFFFFF;">Characters (give all above units att. and/or def. support. They are obtained automatically and for free throughout the game.)</span></li><br>
<br><span style="color:FFFFFF;">Forts/Castles (give all above units def. support. They may be bought and placed in any owned territory, including newly conquered.)</span></li><br>
<br><span style="color:FFFFFF;">Towers/Rams (only work at Forts/Castles and attackers can only make use of 1 of each. They may be bought and placed in any owned territory, including newly conquered.)</span></li><br>
<br><span style="color:FFFFFF;">Sea (can transport land units and do battle at sea.)</span></li>
</ul>
<br><span style="font-size:14px;color:FFFFFF;">Nations share the same land unit types.</span><br>
<br><span style="font-size:14px;color:FFFFFF;">Nations receive free land Auxiliaries in their capitals every round. An exception to this is the Undead. They only receive their Skeleton Auxiliaries every second round.</span><br>
<br><span style="font-size:14px;color:FFFFFF;">Nations receive free Generals, free Wizards and free Priestesses as the game progresses.</span><br>
<br><span style="font-size:14px;color:FFFFFF;">Nations have different air and sea unit types.</span><br>
<br><span style="font-size:14px;color:FFFFFF;">All air units have a maximum build allowed. All, except the Greenskins, have the ability to transport characters by air. Only the Dwarves have the ability to transport Marines by air.</span><br>
<br><span style="font-size:14px;color:FFFFFF;">Young dragons will appear on the map. They are hostile to the six player nations as they belong to the primitive races. However, young dragons can be captured in combat by defeating their protecting master units. When young dragons are captured, they grown up to become regular dragons with multiple hit points. All types of dragons will weaken enemy units by inducing terror.</span><br>
<br><span style="font-size:14px;color:FFFFFF;">A damaged dragon will heal 1 hit point per round. However, by flying it to an allied Village, Town or City, the dragon will heal an additional 1, 2 or 3 hit points.</span><br>
<br><span style="font-size:14px;color:FFFFFF;">Air units, including dragons, can fly around freely. They do not need to land in friendly territories by the end of a turn. They can even end up in and survive in sea territories. However, no air units are able to capture enemy territories on their own. They can only do this by carrying characters with them, or Marines in case of the dwarves.</span><br>
<br>
<br><b><span style="font-size:16px;color:FFFA74;">National Advantages:</span></b><br>
<br><span style="font-size:14px;color:FFFFFF;">Crowton is an old and seafaring nation. A Small-Ship with a Marine is built at "Glassville" and added to the Crowton fleet every third round, but only as long as Crowton dominates this village.</span><br>
<br><span style="font-size:14px;color:FFFFFF;">Elves can hold and protect the "Oorsik Forest". The native Wood Elves living there will in return give an endless supply of elven bowmen.</span><br>
<br><span style="font-size:14px;color:FFFFFF;">Greenskins have a free and endless supply of Warg Rider Rangers as long as they hold the "Warg Caves".</span><br>
<br><span style="font-size:14px;color:FFFFFF;">Lionia and its people are adamant on destroying the undead threat to the world. Volunteer Crusaders will rally at the teleporting gate in the "Jade Mountains" as long as Lionia secures this mountain area.</span><br>
<br><span style="font-size:14px;color:FFFFFF;">Undead are in control of a deadly Zombie-Plague. The plague is airborne and creates undead Zombies every turn. However, when the plague faces an enemy army, the enemies will try to eradicate it.</span><br>
<br><span style="font-size:14px;color:FFFFFF;">Dwarves can hold and protect the "Halfling Meadows" and "Gnomen Lowland". Halflings and Gnomes will in return give an endless supply of military auxiliary units.</span><br>
