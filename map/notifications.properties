Prologue=<body><center><img src="Prologue.png"/></center><b>Prologue:</b><br>The dangerous dragons of war have been extinct since the first age. The forces of evil<br>have been dormant for centuries. The free peoples, Elves, Dwarves and the humans of<br>Lionia, have been living in peace and security for generations. Or so they thought. In the<br>places where evil dwells, a lust for blood, land and power has grown. Also, rumors of<br>warmongering among the primitive races and sightings of young dragons create concern.<br><br>It is now clear that the wicked king of Crowton, the blood lusting chief of the Greenskins<br>and the unholy lord of the Undead have formed an evil alliance. They want to divide,<br>subdue and enslave the entire world. Only a combined resistance by the good and free<br>peoples can fight off this evil. But, this time the good will not let the forces of darkness<br>have monopoly on the mighty war beasts ... the dragons.<br><br></body>
